Sometimes—most years in fact—I feel the same. But this year, I definitely *feel* older. I accomplished, and did a lot, during 24. I moved cities and jobs, said goodbye to people I love, and spent a ton of time on airplanes. Maybe that's why?\n\nWhatever the case, I'm tremendously excited for 25.\n\nEven though I'm only hours into a quarter century, I can't help thinking that I need to move faster already. There's so much I want to do, and 25 seems like the year to do it.\n\nPeople love picking words or phrases to label time periods: Renaissance, Industrial Revolution, etc. I'm often opposed to this as it generalizes way too much. But for 25, what the heck. Might as well. ([Medium did it for 2017.](https://medium.com/wordsthatmatter))\n\n*Focus.*\n\nTwenty-five will be a year of focus for me: A year to be more intentional about what I spend time on and who I spend time with.\n\nI won't be stingy with my time. But I will protect it from things I [don't want to do](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html). What do I want to do? More of the same things that give me joy: building tech products that people want, writing for myself and for others, meeting new people in this awesome (still-newish-to-me) city, and giving my time to those I love so they can help me spend it.\n\n***\n",date:"2018-01-04T19:30:00.000Z",frontmatter:"title: Twenty-Five\ndate: 2018-01-04 19:30:00",slug:"2018-01-04-twenty-five",title:"Twenty-Five",url:"/blog/2018/01/04/twenty-five/"},{body:"\nDo you remember the Internet without ads? Most likely not.\n\nI vaguely remember in the early 2000s you could surf for what felt like hours without seeing any. Maybe I'm misremembering. Maybe ads were less intrusive. Maybe they were less *follow-you-around-the-web-until-you-buy-the-shoes-you-looked-at* annoying. It's really difficult to imagine an Internet without them nowadays. They aren't naturally part of the Web's grain, but they've cemented themselves to it pretty darn well.[^1]\n\nLet's consider something like Spotify or Bloomberg.com.\n\nIf you subscribe, then you get the full service for as long as you pay. That seems pretty fair.\n\nIf you don't, the user experience breaks to accommodate ads. Your time and attention are taxed for this. You can't listen to songs or read articles *right* when you want to consume them. Minute-long audio ads or six-second ad walls (à la Bloomberg) trap some of your time. Your attention also suffers because of the context switching. If I'm in programming [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)), I don't want my 150 BPM music suddenly cut for an ad about Harry's razors.\n\nUnfortunately, the more insidious side of ads doesn't include ad/pay walls or context switching. It's that products are designed to be (unethically) addictive. Whatever utility Facebook, Instagram, et al. had was corrupted by trying to get people to click on more ads. The incentives are just really misaligned. Lots of people—in fact billions—are fine with this, but if they fully understood the tradeoff, they might not be.\n\nCurrently, ad-supported models demand creators constantly grow their time spent, page views, clicks, conversions, etc. For example, article headlines are *engineered* to attract new readers (so they can see ads), not for their existing, paying subscribers.[^2] Content has to be crafted so more eyeballs view it *and* advertisers are content.\n\nYou see what's so wrong here?\n\nThe blogger writes for his/her readers, but the advertiser paying them likely doesn't know or care what they are writing about. Or at least not as much as their fans do. A lot of creators are too quick to insert ads, assuming their fans won't pay for something. But they [never ask](http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/11/asking-members-to-support-its-journalism-no-prizes-no-swag-the-guardian-raises-more-reader-revenue-than-ad-dollars). A [thousand true fans](http://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) are much more powerful than ads.\n\nI think there is a middle way, where consumers still have access to high quality content on the Web and creators can earn enough to keep creating that very content. It won't happen right way, but there's already a shift towards it. Companies, like [Patreon](https://patreon.com) and [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/), are leading the charge to normalize the idea of paying for things, especially the non-material things you love (videos, articles, [OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)). They are redefining the creator/consumer relationship.\n\nSlowly chipping away at ads on the Web.\n\n–\n\nI encourage you to consider paying for the services you use and love. You can support a creator so they don't have to turn on ads, can remove them, and/or more importantly pursue what they love. Plus, you get to use the *real* thing. It's a win-win.\n\nI support a journalling app, [Day One](http://help.dayoneapp.com/day-one-2-0/day-one-pricing), monthly.

One that I'm really proud of and excited to share, but not yet. I needed to jot down some other thoughts. Clear my mind before I can continue.\n\nThis one's for me. You're most certainly welcome to continue reading below though. If not, see you back here soon.\n\n--\n\nEveryone knows someone that listens *really* well. Perhaps you're that person: Providing the perfect amount of eye contact, head nodding, and subtle encouragement. We should all strive to be this.\n\nThese people make you feel like you are the most important thing in their world at that moment. Like time with you is time well spent. We've all experienced the opposite. People pretending to be engaged, instead thinking of what they are going to say next. We're all guilty from time to time.\n\nIt's tough to find genuine listeners because they often get nothing in return. They offer their time. You lead them along as you wish.\n\nMy grandparents were two of the best listeners I think I'll ever meet. Whenever I talked to them—in person, on the phone, over Skype—I had their full attention. Undivided. They gave me space so I could explain whatever was bouncing around my head. Always adding, rarely subtracting from my thoughts as I went.\n\nI miss them every day. My grandfather passed away in June 2015. My grandmother more recently in August. Over the last year, as I was juggling work, school, and some personal things, I would call my grandmother frequently to check in on her and have someone to talk to. I always hung up a call with her and felt better than when we started talking.\n\nWe talked so often that for a while we scheduled 5:15p on Wednesdays for our conversations. I was walking home from work and she had some time before starting dinner. Some days I would run a little late. So she would call me. \"Is it five-fifteen yet?\" she would say when I picked up the phone.\n\nIt was an invitation for me to tell her how my day went and start speaking. Five-fifteen. It's as if she was saying: *I'm ready to listen, go ahead.*\n\n***",date:"2017-11-11T21:30:00.000Z",frontmatter:'title: "This One’s for Me"\ndate: 2017-11-11 21:30:00',slug:"2017-11-11-this-ones-for-me",title:"This One’s for Me",url:"/blog/2017/11/11/this-ones-for-me/"},{body:"\nI started journaling a little over three years ago. Every night before I go to sleep, I open up [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) and type something. It can be about people I have known for a while or just met that day. Events experienced for the first time or things I've been doing so long I don't remember when I started. I often introspect on decisions, emotions, motivations.\n\nI capture a lot. And it initially wasn't a conscious decision to do so.\n\nMany that know me, know that I love checking out new apps and tech. A few years ago, when I was visiting the [Cape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod) during the fourth of July, [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) was Apple's *Free App of the Week*.[^1] So, I downloaded it to try it out. The result is 1,135 entries in 1,045 days from all over the planet: Boston, Manhattan, Istanbul, Bangalore, and many more places.\n\nIt's rewarding to look back at entries and dive into my thoughts/life at that snapshot. Definitely something that will make me more and more nostalgic as more time passes. Reading old entries also makes me excited for the future. When I read what I wrote a six months ago, a year ago, and even further into the past, sometimes I'm embarrassed with myself.\n\nFeeling uncomfortable about my past self means I've grown in some way. Often people don't realize they are changing unless they know what they *used* to be like. They might be able to acknowledge what the changes are, but they likely can't explain why or how they happened. I'd like to think journaling helps me narrow down the catalysts for my own transformations. Just a bit.\n\nMany a time, I've found solace in pecking away at my keyboard after a long day. A sort of soothing one-way conversation, where I can take thoughts out of my head and let them rest somewhere else.\n\n***\n\n*[Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) is a beautiful app and—if you couldn't gather from this post—one of my favorites. I love all the data that it captures. And that it makes it easy to, well, write. My two favorite features are a map that let's you filter your journals by location and tagging collections of entries, like \"Rebecca London 2017.\"*\n\n*If typing isn't your thing, there's an auto-journaling feature based on your geo, movement, and other data captured by your phone.*\n\n### Notes\n\n[^1]: [Unfortunately it doesn't look like they are continuing the Free App of the Week any more starting with iOS 11](https://ios.gadgethacks.com/news/where-is-free-app-week-ios-11-0180432/)",date:"2017-10-22T19:15:00.000Z",frontmatter:"title: Day One\ndate: 2017-10-22 19:15:00",slug:"2017-10-22-day-one",title:"Day One",url:"/blog/2017/10/22/day-one/"},{body:"\n1.

We often hold on to them far past their expiration. When they are no longer healthy, helpful, or what we *actually* want from ourselves. Why? Because humans are creatures of habit. We need something to ground us. They are *shortcuts* allowing us to spend time on more important things: swiping right on Tinder, binge watching Netflix after work, etc.\n\nI joke, but something I've been thinking about more and more lately is *iterating* upon my habits. Taking a fresh look at habits I practice and evaluating if they still provide meaningful value. Or if I'm just doing them because I've *always* done them. They might have made complete sense until they became involuntary parts of my day. I'm not the same person I was a year ago, why should I do the same habits?\n\nAdmittedly, it's really tough to change these things, especially the deep, enduring ones. But you totally can. First, experiment. If you want to break your college habit of staying up, simply make a change for a week. Really commit to yourself for seven days to go to sleep early. Then decide if you want to continue. If you miss it, you can always revert and go back.\n\nI did something similar for my excessive phone use.\n\nI wanted to own my own time and not get constantly interrupted by my phone so I gradually took three steps. The first iteration was turning off all notifications except for Messages.app and Phone.app. Next, I scheduled *Do Not Disturb* from 10p to 6p (nearly the whole day). This allowed me to be more intentional about when I used my phone and why.\n\nThe more extreme—and third—step was removing all social apps (Snapchat, Insta, Twitter) and Gmail. I got rid of Facebook in college and it was a huge productivity boost. Twitter was the hardest to remove because I get a lot of value from it. But I realized that my mobile use of Twitter (and email) was almost always about undirected consumption—it was dead time in read-only mode.\n\nRemoving Snapchat supplied plenty of FOMO initially, since it's my only means of communication with some friends. After a week without it, all the fear subsided. In total, this whole experiment took over two weeks. It was anxiety inducing. I actually cried a little. Just for a couple minutes. I wanted to quit. \n\nLot's of people *say* they really want to break habits or create new ones, but they start off with high hopes and even higher expectations. This habit stuff is hard work. Experimenting helps set more realistic expectations, boosting your confidence in the short term and giving you a chance to succeed in the long term.\n\nAlong with experimenting, another great way to make progress is through small chunks of consistent effort—think slow and steady wins the race. It's achievable. If you want to get in shape, you're almost better off doing any type of exercise as long as you do it consistently. Rather than spend tons of time crafting the perfect workout, only to dread doing it. Show up everyday and try.\n\nWitnessing small chunks of consistent effort from the outside is extremely dangerous. It actually looks *effortless*. This is true for professional athletes, startup founders, or really anyone performing at a high level. It appears these people achieved overnight success. Likely what they did was a combination of consistently work hard and experiment until they found what worked for them.\n\nThere's a lot of conflicting research about habits (you can only replace, not break them) and lot's of opinions floating around the Internet (including mine). No one knows your habits better than you though. Make a list with as many as you can think of. Meditate on it. What is part of *you* that you want to discard? What do you want to do that you aren't doing right now?\n\nI find myself asking these questions every once in a while helps me stay more present. These habits are ones I iterate and opt in to.\n\n***\n\n*There are many other great ways to change habits, like adding/removing [triggers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=habit+triggers).

There's so much to learn, so much to do.\n\nFor a little over a year, I've been academically-trained as a data scientist through graduate school. Before that I did my Bachelor's in Information Systems, and taught myself how to code iOS apps on the side. Today, I work as a software engineer doing databases, back-, and front-end. Last week, I built a [web app](https://notational.co/). \n\nMy daily tools are things like Python, Vue, Swift, Pandas, D3, SCSS, Postgres, ES6, Spark, Webpack, Git---you get the point. I always thought tools were a good way to define what you do. They shape you just as much as you shape your work with them. Carpenters have their hammer. Mechanics their wrench. Usually they don't significantly overlap.\n\nFor me its never really been about the tools though. I find comfort in the words of my favorite Internet person---a self-described \"designer who writes\"---[Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/), when he says:\n\n> When it comes to nouns, I have a public relations problem: no one knows what I do.[^1]\n\nHe continues on to talk about a hypothetical party where there are peers familiar with his work: designers, typographers, illustrators, web folks. Since the party is naturally separated into cliques (typographers with typographers, etc), he visits and chats with them all. In the process of talking to the designers, they think he's a typographer. The typographers think he's an illustrator. You might see where this is going.\n\nFrank says he is shapeshifting across borders, and I totally agree. Being able to cross borders in any profession is an asset. But it doesn't always feel this way, especially in tech. There's always a Javascript framework-of-the-month, people tell you to learn (or not learn) *X*, and machine learning is so hot right now. Specialism is at a constant war with generalism. Perhaps it's just the nature of tech nowadays.\n\nThe other angle I tried to view who I am through is what I work on in my free time. Let what I do when no one's watching define me. Distilling that to one or even a few things is hard too, but I did learn that I generally like making *things*: iOS apps, websites, data visualizations. I make things of all sorts, irrespective of if I know how or have done it before.\n\nWhen I was younger, I used to draw all the time. As I grew up, I wanted to be an animator on a Pixar-like movie.[^2] Projects I worked on helped me gain new skills, and those skills made me interested in doing new, often orthogonal, things.\n\nAlthough I don't draw as much anymore, I feel like making apps---*things* or products---is my new creative, euphoria-inducing outlet.\n\nUltimately, it's all about the product. If it's a fun idea and I don't know how to do it, I'll run through walls to figure it out. I sort of like the term: *maker*, but it's very vague (and slightly overused by people that don't actually ship stuff). *Engineer* and *developer* also fall victim to the same thing. [Caitlin McDonald](http://www.caitlinamcdonald.com/) calls herself a \"deselopreneur\" (DESigner + devELOPer + entrepRENEUR).\n\nIt would be very tempting to steal deselopreneur or just call myself a maker. In a few weeks after I slapped that onto the front of my site, I would probably start searching again. It wouldn't feel right.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm going to noodle on something and not going to call myself anything. To the data scientists, I'll probably be a front-end developer. To the front-end developers, I'll probably be an iOS engineer. Officially, I'm never going to feel like only one of those things so why limit myself to a single label?\n\nThe territory sometimes comes with misunderstanding about what I do, imposter syndrome, and bag of other not-so-fun things. However, I take solace from getting to walk across the borders and experience the other territories every once in a while. Very few do.\n\n---\n\nThanks for reading!

Perhaps it means something to you. The interesting part of the underlying concept is not the combination of the finance and technology industries. It's the *directionality* of it.\n\nDoes a company come from a mostly finance or mostly technology background?\n\nIn the case of [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com), [Robinhood](https://www.robinhood.com), and [Acorns](https://www.acorns.com) they primarily approach fintech from a technical perspective. Engineers are at the core of their business.  Suits and spreadsheets are replaced by hoodies and code. This type of fintech is relatively new.^[Post-2008 when a large number of these companies were founded.] It's techfin: software eating finance.^[Software is eating the world—every company is a technology company, or has to become one to stay relevant in the long term. [First penned by Marc Andreessen](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460).]\n\nFar to the other end is where companies approach fin tech from a finance perspective. Traditionally, these large, gray monoliths have treated *engineering* as a cost center. Not core to their business. (Plus, they call it Information Technology.) In doing so, they are slow to adopt change, especially technology—which changes constantly. They prefer to buy Microsoft Office *Y - 4*.^[The previous version of Microsoft Office, where *Y* is the current year minus four. Example: Office 2016 becomes Office 2012.]\n\nAmong other things, this *Internet Explorer* environment breeds risk aversion. No one wants to be responsible for implementing/upgrading tech since the perceived absolute risk is much larger than any reward. It's programmed into finance's DNA of not wanting to be in the red.\n\nAll this is not to say finance-driven fintech is dead/dying. As the incumbent, it's not. Tech-driven fintech has problems too: engineers have less financial domain knowledge, etc.\n\nRegardless of directionality, what's important is organizational culture. Culture of embracing both the *fin* and *tech* parts of fintech. Consultants can implement some cool, new tech at a 200-year old bank, but what happens when they leave? Like a transplant, does the company reject it? How long do engineers want to solve finance problems at a venture-backed startup with shrinking runway?\n\nWhen two industries collide it's difficult to tell which will come out on top. The one that has the more favorable hand is likely the one that challenges the \"because we've always done it that way\" mentality and embraces change.\n\nMy money is on technology.\n",date:"2016-08-04T20:24:00.000Z",frontmatter:'title: "Finance’s Tech Problem"\ndate: 2016-08-04 20:24:00',slug:"2016-08-04-finances-tech-problem",title:"Finance’s Tech Problem",url:"/blog/2016/08/04/finances-tech-problem/"},{body:"\nWhy is it that (most) every technology company on the planet tries to create their own email system?

And the list keeps going.\n\nOh, so you don't think Facebook Messenger and Twitter DM are email systems? Let's re-write that sentence, substituting the *definition of email* for *email*. Facebook Messenger and Twitter DM are \"methods of exchanging digital messages between computer users.\" Looks like it passed the definition test!\n\nAll kidding aside, most of the companies you read above did not start out in the electronic mail business. Many probably never intended to. So why did they? Besides asking the product managers, let's think through this.\n\nEmail is sticky.\n\nSo sticky that you probably checked it sometime before reading this. Perhaps 30 minutes ago. If not, you definitely did today. You might even be one of those people that scrolls through email in bed or when you go to the bathroom. (I assure you, that's not as disgusting as people that have 1,000+ unread emails sitting in their inbox.)\n\nBecause it's so sticky it constantly brings back users. In case you missed the Internet over the last few years, users are so hot right now. Their eyeballs and data are great for things like ads (thanks, Google). If that wasn't a big enough reason, email is the Internet's form of identity. You know the drill: *please enter your email address and password to log in*.\n\nUsers, data, and identity management seem like an intoxicating combination for why you would jump into the email game. That said, we are also excluding the most obvious reason—companies pay a lot of money for email.\n\nWith those very plausible sounding reasons in mind, we turn to the name of this post, \"Zawinski's Law.\" You guessed it! It's actually a law:\n\n> Every program attempts to expand until it can read email. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.[^1]\n\nAlbeit a somewhat loose interpretation, these companies create email systems because they *have* to. Their software engineers do it to themselves. It might start out innocently as, \"let's just send the user a notification/reminder/alert/message,\" but quickly it becomes the user needs to \"customize the message text,\" \"view/organize messages\" (inbox), \"search messages\", etc.[^2]\n\nJust as email is sticky for users, it's also sticky for companies that provide it. Many join the email business and never leave it.\n\n### Notes\n\nI first discovered Zawiski's Law in Gabriel Weinberg's delightful *[Mental Models I Find Repeatedly Useful](https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d#.1lxyolll0)*.\n\n[^1]: [Zawinski's Law on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski#Principles)\n\n[^2]: Paul Buchheit started Gmail as a [search engine for email](http://time.com/43263/gmail-10th-anniversary/).\n",date:"2016-07-25T19:22:00.000Z",frontmatter:'title: "Zawinski’s Law"\ndate: 2016-07-25 19:22:00',slug:"2016-07-25-zawinskis-law",title:"Zawinski’s Law",url:"/blog/2016/07/25/zawinskis-law/"},{body:'\nA little over a year ago, I traded Boston for [Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore).

There\'s something extremely liberating about leaving your material possessions behind and living out of a suitcase.\n\n---\n\n<video controls>\n  <source src="/blog/assets/2016/4/rain.m4v" type="video/mp4">\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n\n![Amer Fort](/blog/assets/2016/4/fort.jpg)\n\n<video controls>\n  <source src="/blog/assets/2016/4/tuk.m4v" type="video/mp4">\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n\n![Tasty food](/blog/assets/2016/4/food.jpg)',date:"2016-07-24T16:51:00.000Z",frontmatter:"title: Indian Summer\ndate: 2016-07-24 16:51:00",slug:"2016-07-24-indian-summer",title:"Indian Summer",url:"/blog/2016/07/24/indian-summer/"},{body:'\nA few days ago, I was looking for a way to get soccer data without having to do too much heavy lifting, and stumbled upon this delightful API: [football-data.org](http://football-data.org). It\'s not fancy, but it works well.\n\nRight now you have to request everything (seasons, leagues, teams, players, and fixtures) by id, which is kind of painful. Although, once you find an id, you are off running.\n\nHere\'s a quick Python script to get all the players across Europe\'s major leagues (avoiding rate limits) and store them in a `.csv`. Alternatively, download all 5,000+ players [here](/blog/assets/2016/3/players.csv).\n\n```python\nimport csv\nfrom enum import Enum\nimport re\nfrom requests.packages.urllib3.util import Retry\nfrom requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter\nfrom requests import Session, exceptions\n\n\nclass FootballDataApi(object):\n  url = "http://api.football-data.org/v1/"\n\n  def __init__(self, key):\n    super(FootballDataApi, self).__init__()\n    self.key = key\n\n  class Endpoint(Enum):\n    seasons = "soccerseasons/"\n    teams = "soccerseasons/{}/teams"\n    players = "teams/{}/players"\n\n  def getRequest(self, endpoint):\n    s = Session()\n    s.mount(self.url, HTTPAdapter(\n        max_retries=Retry(total=5, status_forcelist=[429], backoff_factor=45)\n        )\n    )\n    headers = {\n      "X-Auth-Token": self.key,\n      "X-Response-Control": "minified"\n    }\n    r = s.get(url=self.url + endpoint, headers=headers)\n    print("GET {}".format(self.url + endpoint))\n    json = r.json()\n    return json\n\n  def getSeasons(self):\n    seasons = self.getRequest(self.Endpoint.seasons.value)\n    return seasons\n\n  def getTeams(self, season_id):\n    season = self.getRequest(self.Endpoint.teams.value.format(season_id))\n    return season["teams"]\n\n  def getPlayers(self, team_id):\n    team = self.getRequest(self.Endpoint.players.value.format(team_id))\n    return team["players"]\n```\n\nThe API wrapper above helps you get all the leagues, players, and teams in a jiff. Just pop in your API key ([sign up here](http://api.football-data.org/register)) and play some Fifa while you wait.\n\n```python\n# API Set up\nkey = "YOUR API KEY HERE"\napi = FootballDataApi(key)\n\n\n# SEASONS\nprint("======================================")\nprint("Getting seasons.")\nprint("======================================")\n\nseasons = api.getSeasons()\nleagues = [ {\n    "league_id": league["id"],\n    "league_name": league["caption"],\n    "league_short_name": league["league"],\n    "league_year": league["year"]\n  }\n  for league in seasons ]\n\nprint("======================================")\nprint("Got {} leagues.".format(len(leagues)))\nprint("======================================")\n\n\n# TEAMS\nprint("Getting teams.")\nprint("======================================")\n\nteams = []\nfor league in leagues:\n  league_teams = api.getTeams(league["league_id"])\n  for lteam in league_teams:\n    team = {\n      "team_id": lteam["id"],\n      "team_name": lteam["name"],\n      "team_short_name": lteam["shortName"],\n      "team_market_value": lteam["squadMarketValue"],\n      "team_crest": lteam["crestUrl"],\n      "league_id": league["league_id"],\n      "league_name": league["league_name"],\n      "league_short_name": league["league_short_name"],\n      "league_year": league["league_year"]\n    }\n    teams.append(team)\n\nprint("======================================")\nprint("Got {} teams.".format(len(teams)))\nprint("======================================")\n\n\n# PLAYERS\nprint("Getting players.")\nprint("======================================")\n\nplayers = []\nfor team in teams:\n  print("======================================")\n  print("{}".format(team["team_name"].upper()))\n  print("======================================")\n  team_players = api.getPlayers(team["team_id"])\n  for tplayer in team_players:\n    print("{}: {} ({})".format(tplayer["jerseyNumber"], tplayer["name"], tplayer["position"]))\n    market_value = tplayer["marketValue"]\n    if market_value is not None:\n      market_value = re.sub("[^\\d\\.]", "", market_value)\n\n    player = {\n      "id": tplayer["id"],\n      "jersey_number": tplayer["jerseyNumber"],\n      "name": tplayer["name"],\n      "nationality": tplayer["nationality"],\n      "position": tplayer["position"],\n      "birth_date": tplayer["dateOfBirth"],\n      "contract_until": tplayer["contractUntil"],\n      "market_value": market_value,\n      "team_id": team["team_id"],\n      "team_name": team["team_name"],\n      "team_short_name": team["team_short_name"],\n      "team_market_value": team["team_market_value"],\n      "team_crest": team["team_crest"],\n      "league_id": league["league_id"],\n      "league_name": league["league_name"],\n      "league_short_name": league["league_short_name"],\n      "league_year": league["league_year"]\n    }\n    players.append(player)\n\nprint("======================================")\nprint("Got {} players.".format(len(players)))\nprint("======================================")\n\n\n# WRITE TO CSV\nfilename = "players.csv"\nprint("Writing `players` to `{}`...".format(filename))\nprint("======================================")\n\nwith open(filename, "w") as csvfile:\n  fieldnames = [\n      "id", "jersey_number", "name", "nationality", "position", "birth_date",\n      "contract_until", "market_value", "team_id", "team_name", "team_short_name",\n      "team_market_value","team_crest","league_id","league_name","league_short_name",\n      "league_year"\n    ]\n  writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)\n  writer.writeheader()\n  writer.writerows(players)\n\nprint("Done.")\nprint("======================================")\n```\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\nYou can read more about the [API internals here](http://api.football-data.org/api_internals) and view the [documentation here](http://api.football-data.org/documentation).',date:"2016-06-20T20:16:00.000Z",frontmatter:"title: An API for Soccer Data\ndate: 2016-06-20 20:16:00",slug:"2016-06-20-an-api-for-soccer-data",title:"An API for Soccer Data",url:"/blog/2016/06/20/an-api-for-soccer-data/"},{body:'\nAfter not touching [D3.js](https://d3js.org) for a long time, I recently started using it again at work.

I still remember sitting in a class lecture [mesmerized by his words](http://paulgraham.com/start.html)---not paying attention to anything else.\n\nRecently, I started to re-read them from the beginning. (Starting with [*Programming Bottom-Up*](http://paulgraham.com/progbot.html).) What follows are my favorite quotes.\n\n---\n\n#### [Design and Research](http://paulgraham.com/desres.html) (Jan 2003)\n\n> Design doesn't have to be new, but it has to be good. Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to be new.\n\n#### [Taste for Makers](http://paulgraham.com/taste.html) (Feb 2002)\n\n> It's rare to get things right the first time. Experts expect to throw away some early work. They plan for plans to change.\n\n#### [Succinctness is Power](http://paulgraham.com/power.html) (May 2002)\n\n> In fact, the most accurate measure of the relative power of programming languages might be the percentage of people who know the language who will take any job where they get to use that language, regardless of the application domain.\n\n#### [Revenge of the Nerds](http://paulgraham.com/icad.html) (May 2002)\n\n> If you start a startup, don't design your product to please VCs or potential acquirers. Design your product to please the users. If you win the users, everything else will follow. And if you don't, no one will care how comfortingly orthodox your technology choices were.\n\n> In programming languages, as Erann Gat has pointed out, what \"industry best practice\" actually gets you is not the best, but merely the average.\n\n#### [Why Arc Isn't Especially Object-Oriented](http://paulgraham.com/noop.html)\n\n> But it seems more dangerous to put stuff in that you've never needed because it's thought to be a good idea.\n\n#### [The Other Road Ahead](http://paulgraham.com/road.html) (Sep 2001)\n\n> Ordinary users shouldn't even know the words \"operating system,\" much less \"device driver\" or \"patch.\"\n\n#### [Being Popular](http://paulgraham.com/popular.html) (May 2001)\n\n> All you have to do is keep telling your story, and eventually people will start to hear. It's not when people notice you're there that they pay attention; it's when they notice you're still there.\n\n#### [Five Questions about Language Design](http://paulgraham.com/langdes.html) (May 2001)\n\n> I think anything that really smart people really love is worth paying attention to.\n\n#### [Beating the Averages](http://paulgraham.com/avg.html) (April 2001)\n\n> If you ever do find yourself working for a startup, here's a handy tip for evaluating competitors. Read their job listings. Everything else on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent, but the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or they'll get the wrong candidates.\n\n#### [Java's Cover](http://paulgraham.com/javacover.html) (April 2001)\n\n> It may seem cavalier to dismiss a language before you've even tried writing programs in it. But this is something all programmers have to do. There are too many technologies out there to learn them all.\n\n#### [Programming Bottom-Up](http://paulgraham.com/progbot.html) (1993)\n\n> [...] the productivity of a group of programmers does not grow linearly with its size. As the size of the group increases, the productivity of individual programmers goes down.\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\nInterestingly enough my [Intro to Computer Science course](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs1101/a11/) linked to several of Paul Graham's essays on Lisp. (The course was taught using DrRacket, a close cousin of Lisp.)\n\nBut I did not discover the essays (or startups) until a year later!\n\nHey, in 2011, startups weren't as *fashionable* as today.\n\n",date:"2016-05-25T21:03:00.000Z",frontmatter:"title: Paul Graham’s Essays\ndate: 2016-05-25 21:03:00",slug:"2016-05-25-paul-grahams-essays",title:"Paul Graham’s Essays",url:"/blog/2016/05/25/paul-grahams-essays/"},{body:"\nSince April 2014, I have used [Reporter](http://www.reporter-app.com) to collect data about my life---capturing everything from location to sleep quality to how often I am in front of a screen.\n\nA while back, I wrote a [post about my data collection process](/blog/2014/08/02/in-107-days-i've-collected-500-reports-about-my-life/), but haven't done anything since. And now I have over 3.2k reports spanning 745 days.\n\nInspired by [Nicholas Felton's talk at ICA Boston](https://www.icaboston.org/events/aiga-ica-present-nicholas-felton) this past week, I decided to start wrangling with the data so I could:\n\n1. Practice using [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)\n2. And explore what *quantified Tom* looks like [^1]\n\nCharts and code follow.\n\n#### Set Up\n\nAfter importing my Reporter CSV export into a Pandas `DataFrame` and cleaning it up, I was left with 20 columns. (Which I later renamed to make them easier to work with.)\n\nTimestamp of Report (GMT)|Timestamp of Report (Local Time)\nLatitude|Longitude\nWeather|Number of Photos Added\nAmbient Audio (dB)|Ambient Audio Description\nNumber of Steps|What did you learn today?\nWhere are you?|What are you doing?\nWho are you with?|How did you sleep?\nHow many pages did you read tonight?|Are you in front of a screen?\nWhat book are you reading?|Did you exercise today?\nWhat are you thinking about?|Are you wearing your retainer?\n\nThey span multiple data types from categorical to numeric, and most everything in between.\n\n#### *Feel* the Data\n\nOne of my typical first steps is to plot the data to get a *feel* for it. Are there any obvious trends I can quickly identify?\n\nSo that's what I did.\n\n*Did a ton of walking from July to October, traveling around India.*\n\n```python\n# Steps Per Day\ndf2 = df[['local_time','num_steps', 'year']].dropna()\ntable = df2.pivot_table('num_steps', index='local_time', columns='year', aggfunc=np.sum)\ntable.plot()\n```\n\n![Steps Per Day](/blog/assets/2016/2/1.png)\n\n*Also, took a lot of pictures in India. The big spike---the Taj Mahal.*\n\n```python\n# Photos Taken Per Day\ndf2 = df[['local_time','num_photos', 'year']].dropna()\ntable = df2.pivot_table('num_photos', index='local_time', columns='year', aggfunc=np.sum)\ntable.plot()\n```\n\n![Photos Taken Per Day](/blog/assets/2016/2/2.png)\n\n*I read less than I use to.*\n\n```python\n# Nightly Pages Read\ndf2 = df[['local_time','num_pages', 'year']].dropna()\ntable = df2.pivot_table('num_pages', index='local_time', columns='year', aggfunc=np.sum)\ntable.plot()\n```\n\n![Nightly Pages Read](/blog/assets/2016/2/3.png)\n\nIntrigued by the last graph, I decided to dive deeper into my nightly reading habit.\n\n#### Page After Page\n\nI try to read every night before I go to sleep. It relaxes me so I fall asleep faster. Why have I read less lately though?\n\nI can probably guess why, but let's see if the proof is in the data pudding.\n\nFirst, we zoom in on 2015: `df2[df2['year'] == 2015]`.\n\n![Nightly Pages Read (2015)](/blog/assets/2016/2/4.png)\n\nNow it doesn't look as bad.\n\nThree hundred sixteen nights of reading with a modest 10.17 pages a night average. There are tons of zeros though. (Looking at you, August and September.)\n\nLet's zoom in *even* further, and see what I was reading then.\n\n```python\n# Nightly Pages Read (July to October 2015)\ndf2 = df[['local_time', 'num_pages', 'book']].dropna()\ndf2 = df2.ix['07-2015':'10-2015']\ndf2 = df2.pivot(index='local_time', columns='book', values='num_pages')\ndf2.plot()\n```\n\n![Nightly Pages Read (July to October 2015)](/blog/assets/2016/2/5.png)\n\nFrom July to October, I read zero pages 52 days. And that doesn't even include the five days in late-September, where I didn't record any data at all.\n\nI guess [*The Man Who Smiled*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39792.The_Man_Who_Smiled) and [*All The Light We Cannot See*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18143977-all-the-light-we-cannot-see) were boring novels then. False! The data might not capture it, but I enjoyed both of them.\n\nThere *has* to be other factor(s) involved!\n\n#### Correlations Between Pages Read & Other Things\n\nUsing the Pandas `df.corr()` method, I calculated the [Pearson correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient) for number of pages read against step count, time of day, ambient audio (in dB), and number of photos taken.\n\nMy hypothesis was that pages read was somewhat *strongly*, inversely correlated with the other factors. Intuitively, it makes sense---the later you go to sleep, more you are walking around outside, etc, the less likely you will read more pages at night.\n\nPerhaps because you are more tired.\n\nHowever, the closest I got to a *strong* correlation was pages read versus step count. (Pages read versus photos taken was the second highest.)\n\n_|Pages Read|Step Count\nPages Read|1|**-0.237353**\nStep Count|**-0.237353**|1\n\nUnfortuntately, I don't think there is a satisfying *quantitative* answer here. Or at least not with the data I have.\n\nQualitatively though, I think it was because I was in India having the time of my life with my friends.\n\nAnd that's good enough for me.\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\nTweet [@{{ site.twitter }}](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}) if you want to play around with my data or code.\n\n[^1]: This is sort of terrifying.",date:"2016-05-14T19:46:00.000Z",frontmatter:"title: Exploring My Life with Pandas\ndate: 2016-05-14 19:46:00",slug:"2016-05-14-exploring-my-life-with-pandas",title:"Exploring My Life with Pandas",url:"/blog/2016/05/14/exploring-my-life-with-pandas/"},{body:"\nLast week, I completed my first semester as a Data Science Master's student.

Creates a new [bare git repository](http://www.saintsjd.com/2011/01/what-is-a-bare-git-repository/) in the `~/.dotfiles` directory\n2. Sets `home` as the alias for `~/.dotfiles` instead of using `git`\n3. Hides untracked files so `git status` output is manageable\n4. Adds `home` alias to `.zshrc` (might be `.bashrc` for you)\n\n#### Create versions with git\n\nNow, just use `home` instead of `git`.\n\n``` shell\n$ home status\nA .gitconfig\nM .zshrc\n$ home add .gitconfig\n$ home commit -m "Add gitconfig"\n$ home add .zshrc\n$ home commit -m "Add zshrc"\n$ home push\n```\n\n#### Wrapping up\n\nI recommend pushing your local dotfiles repo to [GitHub](https://github.com) so you can clone it when you configure a new computer.\n\n``` shell\n$ alias home="git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME"\n$ home init .dotfiles\n$ home remote add origin https://github.com/tmm/dotfiles\n$ home fetch\n$ home checkout master\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\n[My dotfiles](https://github.com/tmm/dotfiles) on GitHub.\n\n[^1]: GitHub [unofficial guide to dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io)',date:"2016-04-10T08:51:00.000Z",frontmatter:"title: dotfiles with git\ndate: 2016-04-10 8:51:00\ntags: [code, git, dotfiles]",slug:"2016-04-10-dotfiles with git",title:"dotfiles with git",url:"/blog/2016/04/10/dotfiles with git/"},{body:"\nAfter joining [GitHub](https://github.com) in February 2014, I was stuck with a long username.

More like skillfully delaying until the last moment---which is funny because I don't usually procrastinate anything.\n\nNaively though, it seems like by delaying this, I avoid the inevitable for just a little longer.\n\nTomorrow, I graduate from college.\n\n> The journey is the reward.\n\nLike most milestones, we try to capture and cram all the successes, failures, and everything else into one defining moment. Freshmen orientation, calculus three, summer vacation, the cute girl down the hall junior year, and the late nights talking and laughing with friends.\n\nEverything is combined into a tangled mess, irrespective of what, when, where, or who they happened with.\n\nDoing it this way is easier for everyone else to conceptualize what the achievement actually means. What you went through.\n\nBut I was there. I lived through it all.\n\nEmotions don't like being tangled together.\n\nSomewhat conveniently though, these milestones separate into different time periods. And segmentation affords us a great opportunity to briefly reflect before the journey continues forward.\n\nSo without staying up too late before the *big* day, here are a few things I learned over the last four years in no particular order.\n\nNone are from the classroom.\n\n### Stay Present\n\nIt's so easy to get caught up in what people think, what happened in the past, or what's going to happen in the future. Here are the tricks\n\n- Everyone is too focused on themselves to worry about you.\n- Nothing has ever happened in the past or future---everything happens in the now.\n\nEvery so often, stop caring about what other people think and live minute by minute, second by second.\n\n### Learn & Do Anything\n\nWhen you leave school, or any other structured environment, learning never stops. It *always* continues.\n\nIt can actually be more exciting when you step outside the formal, rigid confines and teach yourself. As the teacher, you set your own pace and teach yourself what you want.\n\nOpportunities are bounded only by your desire to learn and do. This year, I taught myself iOS development, simply because I wanted to. You can do anything with the requisite effort.\n\nJust remember---anything worth doing, is worth overdoing.\n\n### Thank & Be Thankful\n\nWhile simple in theory, it's rather difficult in practice: sincerely thank those that mean something to you.\n\nWhen people do something that benefits you, you should always acknowledge their efforts. Even if what they did doesn't work exactly as planned. They are spending some of their precious time on you so it's the right thing to do.\n\nMake sure you convey how much you value them. You may not get another chance. Sometimes a simple \"Thanks\" will suffice, but I recommend handwritten thank you notes or pulling them aside to tell them.\n\nIn the long term, it always pays off to do so.\n\nFinally, take some time to feel thankful for everything and everyone that is a part of your life.\n\n> You often know when you do something for the first time, but you don't often know when you do something for the last time.",date:"2015-05-15T22:50:00.000Z",frontmatter:"title: The days are long, but the years are short\ndate: 2015-05-15 22:50:00\nexcerpt: Tomorrow, I graduate from college.",slug:"2015-05-15-the-days-are-long-the-years-are-short",title:"The days are long, but the years are short",url:"/blog/2015/05/15/the-days-are-long-the-years-are-short/"},{body:"\nIt feels great to make things, especially when other people use those things. It strokes your maker's ego.\n\nAfter teaching myself iOS development for a few months, I decided it was time to make something from scratch on my own.\n\nOver winter break, I made an app using the [Product Hunt API](http://www.producthunt.com/v1/oauth/applications \"Product Hunt API Dashboard\"). The resulting, [Time Machine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/product-hunt-time-machine/id956311358 \"App Store\"), allows you to quickly jump to any day on Product Hunt and view the products. \n\nSomething not innate to Product Hunt already.\n\n### Proud & Impatient\n\nWhen the first version was complete, my initial thought was to get feedback. I sent invites to friends and impatiently waited a few hours, but didn't hear anything.\n\nI had learned iOS development *and* made an useful app.\n\nI was really proud of myself.\n\nMaybe a little too proud\n\nThinking of other people that would find Time Machine relevant and useful, I sent an email to Ryan Hoover, the founder of Product Hunt.\n\n![PH API App](/blog/assets/2015/2/1.png)\n\nI kept it succinct and waited for a reply.\n\n![RE: PH API App](/blog/assets/2015/2/2.png)\n\nNow was my self-proclaimed moment of glory! I quickly jumped over to TestFlight on iTunes Connect and sent him an invite.\n\n![Invite sent!](/blog/assets/2015/2/3.png)\n\nAgain, I waited. Not really sure what I was waiting for.\n\n(That's a lie.)\n\nI was waiting for a download, followed by a message that included a congratulatory comment or some other type of validation. Something to stroke my maker's ego.\n\nInstead, my inbox received a different message.\n\n![Yikes](/blog/assets/2015/2/4.png)\n\nI felt like I blew it. Maybe I did.\n\nI quickly responded.\n\n![Damage control](/blog/assets/2015/2/5.png)\n\nWithout a doubt, the worst feeling you can possibly experience is making something that breaks, fails, and/or gets rejected.\n\nFor better or worse, when you spend time making something, it becomes part of you. And when it doesn't meet expectations---let alone work---that part of you aches a little.\n\nWe all typically set *lofty* expectations.\n\nDon't let failures shake you. Learn from them and keep making.\n\n---\n\nEventually everything worked out. The bug was squashed, Time Machine was [featured on Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/posts/time-machine), and I learned an extremely valuable lesson:\n\n> It's important to ship quickly and get feedback.

What’s your relationship like? How far away are you?\n\nIt seems trivial that more and more people are connected online everyday. Yet, we have a long way to go — with approximately two-thirds of the world still pre-Internet.[^1] With it taking over 30 years for around 2.3 billion to connect, getting another two-thirds is likely to be much faster due to the acceleration and adoption of technology. As these new users come online, there are many interactions for them to participate in, including becoming more social.\n\nHumans are social animals. And with your social graph growing, no surprise, you have a greater potential to be social. Across Facebook’s social technologies: Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, there are 2 billion *monthly active users*.[^2] Almost the entire connected world in one platform in case you are counting.[^3]\n\nBut it’s not just Facebook where people are connecting at scale. People connect across almost every industry and niche on the web. Tinderers swipe more than a billion times per day, trying to find love, hookup, or some other form of affection.[^4] Tinder didn’t exist 24 months ago, yet people have flocked to connect through it. Products, like Slack, allow distributed teams to work all across the globe. Twitch brings 45 million gamers together, geeking out about video games.[^5] People exchange 400 million snaps on Snapchat per day.[^6]\n\nWhile people are *meeting* more and more often with an increasing amount of people than ever before, does this effect relationship quality? Quantitatively, there aren’t numbers to back this up yet — there haven’t been comprehensive studies on these social interactions. But qualitatively, you can *feel* it.\n\nThink about how you feel when you are meeting a date for the first time:\n\n> Do the *same* butterflies in the pit of your stomach exist over Tinder?\n\nYou cannot pick up on social cues: a nervous smile, long role of the eyes, or the moment when you both just giggle because no one has any idea what to say. And this isn’t just inherent to Tinder. It’s baked into Slack meetings, WhatsApp messages, Snapchat stories---all of them---where you cannot *truly* interact in real time, like you could if the other person is actually two feet in front of your face.\n\nNow, this is not necessarily a bad thing. It simply means that proximity doesn’t matter as much as it used to when meeting someone. You could be looking at someone on your phone, who is looking at you from the other end. Maybe he or she is 2,000 miles away, and both of you can still communicate. Definitely a boon for us as social animals.\n\nEven though it seems like we are trending towards a future where people maintain a large number of relationships exclusively online, the most meaningful ones will most likely always include a non-virtual hug, kiss, high-five, or whatever else you do with your loved ones.\n\nAnd those can only happen IRL (so far).\n\n***\n\n### Notes\n\n[^1]: [Internet.org](http://internet.org)\n[^2]: [Facebook\'s WhatsApp tallies 700M monthly active users](http://www.cnet.com/news/facebooks-whatsapp-messaging-service-tallies-700-million-monthly-active-users/)\n[^3]: Granted there is likely some overlap\n[^4]: [Tinder stats show women log on more, men swipe more](http://www.dailydot.com/technology/new-tinder-use-stats/)\n[^5]: [Twitch: what is it, and why has Google bought it for $1bn?](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/25/twitch-google-gaming-video-site)\n[^6]: [Snapchat Sees More Daily Photos Than Facebook](http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/19/snapchat-reportedly-sees-more-daily-photos-than-facebook/)\n',date:"2015-01-20T20:30:00.000Z",frontmatter:"title: Two feet in front of your face, 2000 miles away\ndate: 2015-01-20 20:30:00\nexcerpt: Will Meeting IRL Matter?",slug:"2015-01-20-two-feet-in-front-of-your-face-2000-miles-away",title:"Two feet in front of your face, 2000 miles away",url:"/blog/2015/01/20/two-feet-in-front-of-your-face-2000-miles-away/"},{body:"\n![Are you in front of a screen?](/blog/assets/2014/1/reporter0.png)\n\nOver the last few months, I have made a conscious effort to learn a little more about myself. Whether it's what I spend time doing or who I spend time with, I wanted a lightweight, unobtrusive method for collecting small snippets of data throughout my day.\n\nI tried lot’s of different methods—jotting down notes in small moleskin notebook, pecking away in the iOS notes app—the list goes on and on. None of these methods became ubiquitous in my daily routine and I tended to fade between several at a time.\n\nThe worst part was that all the data was consciously collected.\n\nFor this experiment to be effective, I had to find a method that randomly sampled, minimized complexity, and was accessible all the time.\n\nI settled with my iPhone 4s.\n\n#### Money is circulated. Time is spent.\n\nOne evening, my friend, [Tulio](https://www.instagram.com/tuliojarocki/ ), was scrolling through one of Nicholas Felton’s [Personal Annual Reports](http://feltron.com) and asked me if I had heard of [Reporter](http://www.reporter-app.com).\n\nI said no.\n\nThe next few minutes, I learned about how Reporter performs a few random surveys every day. Each survey, called a *report*, collects user-inputted data as well as data from the phone's sensors. Not only are the survey questions customizable, but the data is also conveniently stored in exportable JSON.\n\nIf not completely sold on the idea, I was at least intrigued.\n\nThe lightweight, random, mobile-first experience was exactly where my other attempted methods fell short. So I fired up the App Store and was disappointed to [see that it cost $3.99](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reporter-app/id779697486).\n\nI almost balked at the purchase, but I realized something:\n\n> If Reporter can help me understand things I care about, perhaps saving me a few minutes each day, then it would definitely prove valuable.\n\nThe $3.99 I *circulated* on Reporter is definitely worth the time I *spend* everyday.\n\n![A push notification I actually like seeing.](/blog/assets/2014/1/reporter1.png)\n\n#### What I report every day\n\n*Time to Report!* is the push notification I see about five times a day. It prompts me to quickly avert my attention to capturing my current circumstances.\n\nReporter has a few has default questions that I originally used—*Are you working? How did you sleep? Who are you with?*—but after a while I added my own and discarded a few of the defaults.\n\n![Who are you with?](/blog/assets/2014/1/reporter2.png)\n\nMy reports almost always comprise four questions: *Who are you with? What are you doing? Where are you? Are you in front of a screen?*\n\nThe exception is right before I go to bed. I put Reporter to sleep and am asked: *How many pages did you read tonight?* And when I wake up, Reporter wakes and asks: *How did you sleep?* (Multiple choice: Great, Ok, Poorly, Not at all)\n\n![What are you doing?](/blog/assets/2014/1/reporter3.png)\n\nBesides Reporter latently recording other things---temperature, battery level, speed, steps---these six questions encompass the only active data I need to capture on my own.\n\nMost reports take only a few seconds and the power comes when the reports start to add up, allowing me to look for answers to my questions:\n\n1. Where do I spend most of my time?\n2. Is sleep quality correlated to how often I am in front of a screen?\n3. What are my more social activities?\n\nThere are many other trends you start to notice that were unrecognizable, or at least *unquantifiable*, before.\n\n> Reporter can illuminate aspects of your life that might be otherwise unmeasurable.\n\n![Where are you?](/blog/assets/2014/1/reporter4.png)\n\nFor me, the power of collecting all this data is simply having all of it.\n\nI have yet to do anything significant yet, like one of Felton’s Annual Reports, but I am able to hold myself accountable based on my past behavior. For example, I started my nightly reading habit around the same time that I began reporting.\n\nEvery night when I do not want to read and would rather browse aimlessly on my phone, I remember that I have to report at the end of the night.\n\nIf I have not read, then a *0* goes into the data set, which irks me a little. It's satisfying to see the visualizations track your progress.\n\n![Are you in front of a screen?](/blog/assets/2014/1/reporter5.png)\n\n## Data ~= Understanding\n\nAfter only superficial exploration, I’m hoping to do something significant with the data at some point so I can really see how my life causally fits together.\n\nUntil then, I’m content with building habits through the app and reflecting on the last 107 days and 500 reports.\n\nLet me know if you try it out [@{{ site.twitter }}](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}) and what your thoughts are.\n\nHappy reporting!\n\n***\n\n### Notes\n\n[Originally published on Medium](https://medium.com/@tfm/in-107-days-ive-collected-500-reports-about-my-life-c4454b9d8456) under the same name.
