## Hello, GitHub!

Thanks for checking out the innards of [my website](https://meagher.co/). Here's what's going on:

* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) graciously hosts my site.
* [CloudFlare](http://www.cloudflare.com) powers my DNS (and SSL ftw ðŸ”’).
* Syntatically Awesome Style Sheets [(a.k.a Sass)](http://sass-lang.com) help make it pretty.
* The beautiful sans-serif and monospaced fonts are [Lato](https://latofonts.com) and [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
* My blog posts are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
* And [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) does just about everything else.

There's not much more to it.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
$ yarn install
