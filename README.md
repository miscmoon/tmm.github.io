## Hello, GitHub!

Thanks for checking out the innards of [my website](http://meagher.co/). Here's what's going on:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) graciously hosts my site.
- [CloudFlare](http://www.cloudflare.com) powers my DNS.
- [Syntatically Awesome Style Sheets (a.k.a Sass)](http://sass-lang.com) help make it pretty.
- My blog posts are written in [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/documentation.html).
- And [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) does just about everything else.

There's not much more to it.
