Recently, someone told me: *do what's right for you now, not what feels good*.

Initially, those words stung---a lot. It was difficult for me to see that what was right and what felt good were not the same because I so desperately wanted them to be.

The challenging part is accepting this tradeoff. Understanding that you will be at ease once you make it through the fray. The best way to stay committed to yourself, and what's right, is to be present with those around you. What's right and what feels good will eventually converge.
