A little over a year ago, I traded Boston for [Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore). From mid-July to the end of October, India was my home.

I rode a Moped in [Goa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa), stayed up way too late coding, saw the sunrise in [Kerela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi,_India), went clübbing with my friends, explored the [Taj Mahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal), and did so many other fun/weird/interesting things.

I learned a lot about culture, food (such a tasty thing to learn), and of course, myself. I know super *cliche* to say—and I'm not much for them. But I did. There's something extremely liberating about leaving your material possessions behind and living out of a suitcase.
