After not touching [D3.js](https://d3js.org) for a long time, I recently started using it again at work. Typically, I use Python—and [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)—for visualization, but nothing beats using SVG and easily adding interactivity. If you've never heard of D3, the little intro snippet on the website sums it up well:

> D3 allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document.

Basically, select your data and use your favorite web technologies (SVG, CSS, and HTML) to make something cool.

I used [Scott Murray's D3 tutorial](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3) as a quick refresher, and made a bar chart using English Premier League soccer data.[^1] (Hit *Animate Bars* and watch what happens.)

<p data-height="465" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="YWwdON" data-default-tab="result" data-user="meagherco" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/meagherco/pen/YWwdON/">D3 & Me</a> by Tom (<a href="http://codepen.io/meagherco">@meagherco</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Mmmmmm, what a tasty transition. (No shame in hitting animate again.)

The chart could be improved further: making it responsive, displaying information on selection/mouseover, etc. Feel free to take a look at the code [on CodePen](http://codepen.io/meagherco/pen/YWwdON).
