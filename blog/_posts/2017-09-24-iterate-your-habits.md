The thing about habits is some—perhaps most—aren't meant to last forever. We often hold on to them far past their expiration. When they are no longer healthy, helpful, or what we *actually* want from ourselves. Why? Because humans are creatures of habit. We need something to ground us. They are *shortcuts* allowing us spend time on more important things: swiping right on Tinder, binge watching Netflix after work, etc.

I joke, but something I've been thinking about more and more lately is *iterating* upon my habits. Taking a fresh look at habits I practice and evaluating if they still provide meaningful value. Or if I'm just doing them because I've *always* done them. They might have made complete sense until they became involuntary parts of my day. I'm not the same person I was a year ago, why should I do the same habits?

Admittedly, it's really tough to change these things, especially the deep, enduring ones. But you totally can. First, experiment. If you want to break your staying up late habit from college, simply make a change for a week. Really commit to yourself for seven days to go to sleep early. Then decide if you want to continue. If you miss it, you can always go back to it.

Lot's of people *say* they really want to break habits or create new ones, but they start off with high hopes and even higher expectations. This habit stuff is hard work. Experimenting helps set more realistic expectations, boosting your confidence in the short term and giving you a chance to succeed in the long term.

Along with experimenting, another great way to make progress is through small chunks of consistent effort—think slow and steady wins the race. It's achievable. If you want to get in shape, you're almost better off doing any type of exercise as long as you do it consistently. Rather than spend tons of time crafting the perfect workout, only to dread doing it. Show up everyday and try.

Witnessing small chunks of consistent effort from the outside is extremely dangerous. It actually looks *effortless*. This is true for professional athletes, startup founders, or really anyone performing at a high level. It appears these people achieved overnight successes. Likely what they did was a combination of work hard consistently and experiment until they found what worked for them.

There's a lot of conflicting research about habits (you can only replace, not break them) and lot's of opinions floating around the Internet (including mine). No one knows your habits better than you though. Make a list with as many as you can think of. Meditate on it. What is part of *you* that you want to discard? What do you want to do that you aren't doing right now?

I find asking myself these questions every once in a while helps me stay more present. These habits are ones I iterate and opt in to.
