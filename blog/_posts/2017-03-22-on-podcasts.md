I started listening to podcasts consistently during a summer internship when I was driving to work everyday.[^1] They are a great way---perhaps the best--- to *be* around smart people and their ideas. (Books are another great way, but I find podcasts have less friction.)

Anyway, I've been beta testing [Breaker](https://breaker.audio/) for the last couple months and it's super! What's even better is that it surfaced the single best podcast episode I have EVER listened to: [*Naval Ravikant on Reading, Happiness, Systems for Decision Making, Habits, Honesty and More*](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/02/naval-ravikant-reading-decision-making/).

Before you read any further, I encourage you to [listen](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/02/naval-ravikant-reading-decision-making/). It's long, but extremely worthwhile. I've already listened three times.

[Naval](https://twitter.com/naval) is not talked about much in the tech press, but definitely should be. He's a co-founder of [AngelList](https://angel.co/) and has also invested in Uber, Twitter, Yammer, etc. Beyond his startup chops, he makes you think deeply about things you *really* should think deeply about.

He covers everything from his foundational core beliefs, the "[monkey mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_monkey)," being true to yourself, mental models, and [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman). I implore you to [listen](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/02/naval-ravikant-reading-decision-making/).

[^1]: I was lucky enough to be the [subject of one](/blog/2015/04/01/hack-to-start-podcast-interview/) before too!
