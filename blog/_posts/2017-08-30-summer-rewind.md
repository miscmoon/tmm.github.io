Wow! It's been over four months since I last posted something on here. A bunch of things have happened since then:

* I guest lectured on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) to an *Intro to Web Apps* course at Boston College,
* I finished my master's thesis and graduated with a M.S. in Data Science,
* my Notational web app launched and reached the [top of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2017-05-24) and was #19 for the day,
* And I joined the team at [Kit](https://kit.com) and moved from Boston to NYC.

These are just the big things. Many people helped me over these months: giving feedback, advice, and time. For that I'm grateful.

Thanks for reading and enjoy what's left of your summer!

If you're around NYC, I would love to talk about tech/projects/anything else you're working on. You can [email](mailto:meagher.co) or [tweet](https://twitter.com/tomfme) me.
