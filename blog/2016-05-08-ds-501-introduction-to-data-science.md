Last week, I completed my first semester as a Data Science Master's student. Over the 14 weeks, I learned a bunch about a wide variety of topics, especially in DS 501.

Pre-Spring Break | Post-Spring Break
--- | ---
1/20: Introduction | 3/16: Machine Learning Part 2
1/27: Data Gathering | 3/23: Visualization
2/3: Data Storage | 3/30: Large-Scale Data Analysis
2/10: Business Intelligence | 4/6: Graph Data
2/17: Basic Statistics, Probability, and Linear Algebra | 4/13: Graph Data and High Dimensional Data
2/24: Machine Learning Part 1 | 4/20: Deep Learning
2/2: Midterm Exam | 4/27: Final Exam

My classes tackled everything---from [collecting and storing tweets](https://github.com/tmm/DS501/blob/master/1/CaseStudy1.ipynb) in MongoDB, using the Twitter streaming API, to performing [textual analysis of movie reviews](https://github.com/tmm/DS501/blob/master/3/CaseStudy3.ipynb) using Scikit-Learn.

Even though I could have learned all these things on the Internet, the interactive, class-based structure made it more worthwhile.

The next semester starts May 16th!
