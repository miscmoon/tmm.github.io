It feels great to make things, especially when other people use those things. It strokes your maker's ego.

After teaching myself iOS development for a few months, I decided it was time to make something from scratch on my own.

Over winter break, I made an app using the [Product Hunt API](http://www.producthunt.com/v1/oauth/applications "Product Hunt API Dashboard"). The resulting, [Time Machine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/product-hunt-time-machine/id956311358 "App Store"), allows you to quickly jump to any day on Product Hunt and view the products. 

Something not innate to Product Hunt already.

### Proud & Impatient

When the first version was complete, my initial thought was to get feedback. I sent invites to friends and impatiently waited a few hours, but didn't hear anything.

I had learned iOS development *and* made an useful app.

I was really proud of myself.

Maybe a little too proud

Thinking of other people that would find Time Machine relevant and useful, I sent an email to Ryan Hoover, the founder of Product Hunt.

I kept it succinct and waited for a reply.

Now was my self-proclaimed moment of glory! I quickly jumped over to TestFlight on iTunes Connect and sent him an invite.

Again, I waited. Not really sure what I was waiting for.

(That's a lie.)

I was waiting for a download, followed by a message that included a congratulatory comment or some other type of validation. Something to stroke my maker's ego.

Instead, my inbox received a different message.

I felt like I blew it. Maybe I did.

I quickly responded.

Without a doubt, the worst feeling you can possibly experience is making something that breaks, fails, and/or gets rejected.

For better or worse, when you spend time making something, it becomes part of you. And when it doesn't meet expectations---let alone work---that part of you aches a little.

We all typically set *lofty* expectations.

Don't let failures shake you. Learn from them and keep making.

Eventually everything worked out. The bug was squashed, Time Machine was [featured on Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/posts/time-machine), and I learned an extremely valuable lesson:

> It's important to ship quickly and get feedback. But don't forget to sweat the details and double check.
